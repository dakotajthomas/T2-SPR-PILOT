BEFORE THE PAGE CONTENT
You might want to cache the images you are using in the experiment
if timings are going to be recorded during the experiment.
Below is an example of how to load an image without showing it.

<h1>WELCOME!</h1>
<p>
You have been invited to participate in a research study on second language acquisition. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the properties of learning English as a Second Language.
</p>

<h1>DIRECTIONS: Self-Paced Reading</h1>
<p>
    Speakers of a language seem to develop a <i>feel</i> for what is a possible sentence, even in many cases where they have never been taught any particular rules.  For example, in English, you might feel that sentences (a) and (c) sound like possible sentences, whereas (b) and (d) do not.
</p>
<p>
    <b>a)</b>   <i>Mary is likely to win the race.</i>
<br><b>b)</b>   <i>Mary is probable to win the race.</i>
<br><b>c)</b>   <i>It seems that John is late.</i>
<br><b>d)</b>   <i>John seems that he is late.</i>
</p>
<p>
In this experiment, you will read sentences word by word on a computer screen. After every sentence, you will receive a question about the content of the sentence(s). Read each sentence carefully before you answer. Think of the sentences as spoken English and judge them accordingly. Work as quickly and accurately as you can.
</p>
<p>
Each sentence will appear as a series of lines (________ ____ ______ _______________.). The words in the sentences will appear one by one as you press the "Space" bar on the computer. 
</p>
<p>
The following three sentences are practice items.  After the practice items, the experiment will begin.
